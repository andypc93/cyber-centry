        <h2>What is malware?</h2>
        <p>Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any 
            software specifically designed to harm or exploit devices, networks, or users.</p>

        <h2>How is malware classified?</h2>

            Viruses:

            Trojans:
                
            Malicious programs disguised as legitimate software to deceive users into installing them. They often create backdoors for attackers.
            Worms:
                
            Self-replicating programs that spread across networks without user intervention, exploiting vulnerabilities.
            Ransomware:
                
            Encrypts a user's files and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) for their release.
            Spyware:
                
            Collects user information without their knowledge, often for advertising or malicious purposes.
            Adware:
                
            Displays unwanted advertisements on a user's device, often accompanied by tracking features.
            Rootkits:
                
            Conceals malicious software by subverting or disabling security measures on a targeted system.
            Botnets:
                
            Networks of compromised devices (bots) controlled by a single entity for various malicious activities, such as DDoS attacks.</p>

        <h2>Is there a guarantee that antivirus software will protect me from all types of malware?</h2>
