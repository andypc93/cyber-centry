        <h2>What is a threat in cybersecurity?</h2>
        <p>A threat in cybersecurity refers to any potential danger or risk that can 
            exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, or data. These threats can come in various 
            forms and have different intentions, ranging from causing disruption to stealing sensitive information 
            or gaining unauthorized access to systems. Understanding and mitigating cybersecurity threats is crucial 
            for protecting digital assets and maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and 
            availability of information.</p>

        <h2>What are some common types of cybersecurity threats?</h2>
        <p>Common types of cybersecurity threats include malware (such as viruses, ransomware, and spyware), phishing 
            attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, insider threats, and social engineering tactics. Each 
            type of threat aims to exploit vulnerabilities in different ways, posing risks to the security and 
            privacy of computer systems and data.</p>

        <h2>How do cybersecurity threats impact individuals and organizations?</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity threats can have severe consequences for both individuals and organizations. They 
            can result in financial losses, reputational damage, legal liabilities, and compromised personal 
            or sensitive information. For businesses, cybersecurity threats can disrupt operations, lead to 
            data breaches, and cause significant harm to the organization's bottom line and customer trust.</p>

        <h2>How can individuals and organizations protect themselves from cybersecurity threats?</h2>
        <p>To protect against cybersecurity threats, individuals and organizations should implement 
            robust security measures and best practices. This includes using strong, unique passwords, keeping 
            software and systems up to date with security patches, using antivirus and antimalware software, 
            encrypting sensitive data, conducting regular security audits, and providing comprehensive 
            cybersecurity training to employees.</p>
